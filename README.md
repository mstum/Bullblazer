On January 17, 2014, RetroRemakes.com announced their Videogame 50 compilation, a compilation intended to be similar to the legendary [Cassette 50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_50). This "game" here is my contribution, a One-Screen Remake of "Ballblazer" in a cowboy setting and without any of the qualities that made Ballblazer so good. Bullblazer is everything but good, which makes it perfect for this compilation. It was written in about 45 minutes in XNA, most of the time was spent finding a public domain music track that fits into the setting.

There is no license attached to the game or its art assets because I really wouldn't want to claim copyright for this thing - it's public domain and in countries where that's not possible it's CC-0, WTFPL or whatever legal requirement there is for "Do whatever you want with it, just don't complain to me that it's crap".
 
# BULLBLAZER
YEEHAW Cowboy!  
  
Greg the bull is loose on the field, and you surely don't want to take the blame for it, do you?  
Your objective is to capture the bull and bring it into the enemy cowboy's bullpen.  
The problem? The other cowboy is trying to do the same, and you're not allowed to use your trusty revolver to stop him.  
  
Grab the bull by the horns!  
  
CONTROLS  
Cowboy 1 uses W,S,A,D to move and SPACE to throw the bull forward.  
Cowboy 2 uses CURSOR KEYS to move and ENTER to throw the bull forward.  
ESCAPE closes the game.  
F1 toggles between FullScreen and Windowed Mode.  
  
INSTALLATION  
Insert the Bullblazer Disk into your IOMEGA™ ZIP-100™ Drive and run BullBlazer.exe
