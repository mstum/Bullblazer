BULLBLAZER

YEEHAW Cowboy!

Greg the bull is loose on the field, and you surely don't want to take the blame for it, do you?
Your objective is to capture the bull and bring it into the enemy cowboy's bullpen.
The problem? The other cowboy is trying to do the same, and you're not allowed to use your trusty revolver to stop him.

Grab the bull by the horns!
